(a video of our recent dana offering at Susitarama Nunnery in the Sagaing Hills of Burma - you may recognize some of these yogis!)

In Pali, the traditional language of the Buddha’s teachings, dana means “generosity.” It is the very heart of the culture that has carried the Buddha’s teachings over the centuries and is the foundation of our organizational ethics.

In accordance with tradition, all Vipassana Hawai’i teachers offer their teachings free of charge and are supported through the freely-offered generosity of students and supporters. Costs associated with retreats cover the expenses associated with food, lodging, and administration but not teacher time, training, effort, or energy. We believe that this commitment helps keep the purity of the teachings alive and thriving, as it has for millennia.

Many of our greatest teachings regarding dana have come from our time in Burma when we participate in the ancient Buddhist communities that operate solely on the basis of generosity.

Each time we visit we are struck by the powerful wisdom, humility, and beauty of heart that motivates and is manifested by this practice. Dana is a cultural practice as much as a spiritual one and we aim to support a culture of generosity in the west based on these experience and insights.

Supporting the work of Vipassana Hawai’i enables a mutually beneficial relationship between all members of our community from the Board of Directors, to the teachers, to the sangha, the HIMC land, and local community, as well as our humanitarian programs in Southeast Asia. Your generosity is the only thing that enables us to do our work throughout the year.

As one of our teachers in Wachet village, the Mya Taung Sayadaw, always reminded us,

“Each time you give dana you should dedicate it toward your own full enlightenment.”

Most of you are aware that all of our normal in-person retreats for the year have been canceled. This has proven a challenge on many levels, including financially. We are so very glad to be able to create the online conditions to be able to continue to support yogis in their good work. We do hope that in this new reality our sangha is also able to create the means of livelihood for our ongoing journey together in the Dhamma.

Of course, we also have other programs including our work on the land for which your generosity will be of enormous help. [Click here to learn about other ways to support Vipassana Hawai'i](https://vipassanahawaii.org/support/)

Please know that all the talks and instructions will be available on the Phlyt Academy website for a few more weeks. After that they will be available on our website - [vipassanahawaii.org](https://vipassanahawaii.org/) - perhaps only in audio form, depending on our storage capacity! We are happy to make sure that these Dhamma offerings are freely available to all.
