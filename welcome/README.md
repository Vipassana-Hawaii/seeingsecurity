### WELCOME
#### Welcome to Vipassana Hawai ªi's first Online Retreat!

We are very excited to be stepping into this journey with you!

As you can imagine, this format is a little like the unfinished Buddha image above. We are sure we have all the tools we need to finish but thank you for your patience and guidance as we finalize the details.

Each day, the schedule and all the links for the basic retreat offerings will be made available here in the online classroom. At the end of the day, links to recordings of the sessions will be posted so folks who could not watch live will have access as soon as possible.

We will be offering nearly all parts of this retreat via Zoom. This will include a virtual "Dhamma Hall" where we will share space together to:
- Sit
- Listen to instructions
- Participate in Q&A periods
- Hear Dhamma talks

### INTERVIEWS
We will also be doing individual interviews on a 3-day rotation so every yogi will have 3 interviews and the chance to interview with 3 of the teachers.

Your interview times and Zoom details will be sent to you by email.

### DHAMMA HALL
 Several times a day we will hold a shared space for our practice on Zoom. We are calling this the "Dhamma Hall." There may or may not be instructions during these periods but no matter what you will likely feel the sense of yogi camraderie in a unique way - and as yogis on self-retreat, this may be surprisingly supportive.

 We ask you not to speak or "chat" to one another during these sitting periods. *BUT FEEL FREE TO KEEP YOUR MICROPHONE ON* so we build a sense of shared space. As yogis in the same physical space we can hear one another move or cough, hear the noises outside. We have found that when we leave our microphones on during a Zoom sitting, we also feel that sense of shared soundscape that is uniquely wonderful. A few notes about this practice:
 - Feel free to turn off your own speakers if you don't want to listen to the shared soundscape.
 - Consider muting your microphone if you notice that the noises from your world are really dominating the space.
 - Host Teacher has authority to mute anyone to protect the container.
 - If you don't like what you are hearing, just note "aversion"

### COMMUNICATION
 Please only use Zoom's chat function to communicate with host teacher only for technical issues. All Q&A sessions will be for live questions on video.

 If you need to reach out to the teachers or for technical support, please email information@vipassanahawaii.org and we will do our best to respond quickly.

 Normally on retreats we have emergency protocols for yogis experiencing more psychological/spiritual emergencies. In this format there is no way to provide support in an emergency capacity. We *insist* that all yogis have a designated "life-line" - someone or some people who are prepared to receive calls from you at any hour of the night in order to help settle you down and comfort you into a better state of mind. Please communicate with that person in advance of the retreat and give them our contact details.

 ### INTERVIEWS
The interview schedule for this will be complex given the range of geographic location between all of us. Please be understanding in our limited ability to get you to interview with the teacher/s you want. We do not take requests and appreciate your confidence in the entire team.

As usual, you will need to be very careful and considerate about the length of time your interviews take. Three individual interviews for this duration of retreat is quite generous and part of what we are looking forward to being able to offer in ways that may not be so easy in physical retreats of this size. Yogis will be joining a Zoom meeting at their allotted time so there will be no room for overlap or going over.
